# gruyere
Google Gruyere's vulnerable webapp

## Running Gruyere locally

WARNING: Because Gruyere is very vulnerable, it includes some protection against being exploited by an external attacker when run locally. You'll see these parts of the code marked DO NOT CHANGE. Gruyere only accepts requests from localhost and uses a random unique id in the URL. However, it's difficult to fully protect against an external attack. And if you make changes to Gruyere you could make it more vulnerable to a real attack. Therefore, you should close other web pages while running Gruyere locally and you should make sure that no other user is logged in to the machine you are using. 

To run Gruyere locally, you'll first need to install Python 2.7, if you don't already have it. Gruyere was developed and tested with version 2.7 and may not work with other versions of Python. Download Gruyere itself from https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/gruyere-code.zip and unpack it to your local disk. Then to run the application, simply type:

``` $ cd <gruyere-directory> ```

``` $ ./gruyere.py ```
